# Conway's Game Of Life

To play my version of this game, go [here](https://brasbu.github.io/game_of_life/).


### Rules

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.

- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


### Credit

The [javascript.plainenglish.io](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/the-game-of-life-using-javascript-fc1aaec8274f) tutorial was a great way to get started and understand how to implement the game in javascript. This was used mainly to learn how to implement the table creation and updates.
